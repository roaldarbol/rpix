**rpix is currently in alpha. We don't expect to support the entire pixi CLI, but are open to implement useful features - feedback is welcome!**

## Overview
The **rpix** package provides an interface to manage dependencies with [pixi](https://pixi.sh). 

## Installation
**rpix** depends on having **pixi** installed - so if you haven't got it yet, install pixi first.

- **Project template**. For a fully-fledged, ready-to-use R project, create a project with the [r-template](https://github.com/roaldarbol/r-template)
- **Add to existing project**. To add **rpix** to an existing pixi project: `pixi add r-rpix` (**THIS DOES NOT YET WORK, SEE [ISSUE](https://github.com/roaldarbol/rpix/issues/2)**)

``` r
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('roaldarbol/rpix')
```

## Resources

## How to use rpix
``` r
library(rpix)
```
The primary use of rpix is the ability to add dependencies in the console like you normally would with `install.packages` or `renv::install`. With rpix, the command is `add`. Let's try installing the **tidyverse**:

```
rpix::add("tidyverse")
```

*Fun fact: rpix is a inspired by the Danish word **harpiks** which means resin. I see it as the resin that binds pixi into the natural R workflow.*
