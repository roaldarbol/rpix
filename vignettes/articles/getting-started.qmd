## Install Pixi
The first thing that we need to do is install Pixi, which is the engine underlying *rpix*. To do so, follow the installation instructions on [pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/).

## Install *rpix*
Next, you'll need to install *rpix*. For this guide, we'll assume you are using RStudio. 

- Open RStudio
- Create new project (without *renv*)
- Install *rpix*
    - `install.packages("rpix", repos = "https://roaldarbol.r-universe.dev")`

## Setup pixi project
- Initiate pixi project with `rpix::setup_pixi()`
- Restart RStudio with `rpix::restart_rstudio_with_pixi()` for changes to take effect

## Start coding!
When you need new packages, run `rpix::add("package_name")`. If you wish to remove packages, simply `rpix::remove("package_name")`
