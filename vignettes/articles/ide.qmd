Although it is possible to run R directly in the terminal, R is most commonly used with an "interactive development environment" (IDE). The most common IDE for R users is RStudio, but other options exist such as VS Code or, more recently, Positron. 

As most IDEs are not available (or up-to-date) as conda packages, we recommend using a global installation. That can be either from the provider, or a package manager such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh) (macOS).

## RStudio

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}
## Windows

```sh
pixi run rstudio
```

## macOS

```sh
pixi run open -a rstudio
```

## Linux

```sh
pixi run rstudio
```
:::

It is also possible to create a `task`, a shorthand, for opening RStudio. First, add the following to `tasks` in `pixi.toml`:

```yaml
[tasks]
rstudio = "open -a rstudio"
```

## VSCode


## Positron
