# rpix 0.3.0
- `restart_rstudio_with_pixi` has been written to facilitate easier selection of the correct R version
- `setup_pixi` now installs *rpix* from CRAN into the pixi library. It's a hacky solution until it's on conda.

# rpix 0.2.0
- `add` can now add multiple packages simultaneously
- `dry_run` parameter added to multiple functions to allow inspections of pixi commands
- `setup_pixi` command to setup a pixi project from within R. Still very alpha, expect to break.
- `search` allows to search dependencies, their versions and their own dependencies.

# rpix 0.1.0
