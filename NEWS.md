- `add` can now add multiple packages simultaneously
- `dry_run` parameter added to multiple functions to allow inspections of pixi commands
- `setup_pixi` command to setup a pixi project from within R. Still very alpha, expect to break.
- `search` allows to search dependencies, their versions and their own dependencies.
